Project
Name & Category
Project: FairPlay Gaming – Verifiable Randomness Layer
Category: gaming

Description
FairPlay Gaming is a blockchain-based gaming platform that ensures all random-number events (loot boxes, raffles, battle outcomes) are provably fair.  
Using zkProofs and the Soundness Layer (SL), RNG results can be verified without exposing internal seeds or allowing manipulation.  
Problem solved: lack of trust in on-chain games where randomness is often questioned.

SL Integration
- Soundness Layer will be used to verify zkProofs of RNG before final results are recorded on-chain.  
- Example proof: "Given (seed + nonce), RNG output = valid number within range."  
- SL features: zkProof verification, zk-friendly APIs for contracts, and transparent auditability.

Technical
Architecture
Flow: Player action → RNG engine (off-chain worker) → generate random number + zkProof → SL verification → Smart Contract → result stored.  

Stack
- Frontend: React + Next.js  
- Backend: Node.js (RNG worker)  
- Blockchain: Soundness Layer (testnet) + Ethereum (optional for NFT rewards)  
- Storage: IPFS (game item metadata)  

Features
- Core Feature 1: Transparent loot box with verifiable randomness.  
- Core Feature 2: Fair community lottery/raffle.  
- Core Feature 3: Proof-of-Fairness API for other Web3 game developers.  

Timeline
- PoC (2-4 weeks)  
  - Basic loot box contract  
  - Simple zk circuit for RNG  
  - SL proof verification integration  
  - Basic demo UI  

- MVP (4-8 weeks)  
  - Multi-game support (lottery, card RNG)  
  - NFT reward integration  
  - Player dashboard + Proof Explorer  
  - User testing & documentation  

Innovation
- Unique: introduces **Proof of Fairness** for blockchain gaming.  
- Prevents developers from manipulating RNG, increasing trust.  
- Future potential: SDK for other Web3 game studios to adopt Fair RNG.
